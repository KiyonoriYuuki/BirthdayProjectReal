I didn't realize it the first time I heard it but eventually I came to the conclusion that SZA was spitting facts. I realized then that I had made a mistake and that I missed you and the thought of moving on for the first time in my life was something I simply didn't want to do. Despite not following you on anything, people always brought up your name around me which made me loathe the thought of you moving on because just like SZA states in this quote. Nobody gets me like you do."

A lot of the songs in this playlist share a similar theme in the sense that the things I used to enjoy doing became very hard for me. Anything that I did reminded me of you and during my time of reflection I began to ponder what it meant to be in love. Why the feelings of regret poured in more and more as time went on instead of me usually just moving on like I usually do. I realized that I was in love with you and that I didn't want to move on. I didn't want to let go of the memories we shared and the love that we had. I didn't want to let go of you. The lyrics describes the confusion and struggle with letting go and for the first time I was experiencing that. I began to literally ask myself 'why do I hold on to you?'"

        desc: "This song came to me in a very unique way. I was listening to music on Soundcloud because that's where all the banger mixes are and I saw Taylor Swift and ILLENIUM in the title so I had to click on it. I didn't know the Taylor Swift song at the time but I knew Nightlight so I said to myself 'its gonna be the gas anyways.' Since I'm very sensitive to lyrics in music in general, as I listened to the song I couldn't believe how much it related to the situation I went through. The timing and everything is oddly close together too. Back to December? More like Back to November. But yeah, the lyrics describe the regret and the longing for the past that I felt. I realized that I had made a mistake, my selfishness consumed me, and that I missed you. I missed the memories we shared and the love that we had. I was at a point where I began to accept the fact that I had lost you but the regret of not being able to apologize for my actions began to consume me. Even if things weren't going to go back to the way they were, the urge to express my regret was at its strongest when I discovered this song."

Maybe cuz ILLENIUM is on it or maybe it's because we were supposed to see Chainsmokers together. Maybe it's the memory of you being fustrated that everytime Chainsmokers is performing it somehow gets cancelled. I don't know. This quote from the song though kind of stuck out to me though. Perhaps it can be interpretted about the time during the end of the relationship. I was pulling at straws, trying to find reasons to hate you and trying to find a way out because I knew at the time that if you knew the truth of my actions it would devastate you. OBVIOUSLY, despite saying it 100 times I'll say it infinitly more times, that there's nothing but honesty and transparency from here on out. I've already seen what the other side looks like and I don't want to go back there. I don't want to be sad anymore. I don't want you to be sad anymore. Having a chance like this again is truly one in two million (see what I did there) so why would I throw it away?"

I guess you could say Melodic EDM as a whole does that to me. This entire project has been one big DIY in hopes you show how much thought and effort I'm willing to put back int us. You won't even know this until you read it later today but I've been up all night and its almost 7am rn just working on this page trying to push out a finished product.

This song will always hold a place in the memories of you and it also slaps so why not put it in the playlist. 'Also, No Contact, yeah, I tried that' LMAO"

Music in general has been a very powerful means of expression for me so a playlist was the perfect way to 'express' how I felt. The reasons that all lead up to the late night text. The reasons that lead up to me putting in that mother fucking work to pump out a whole website when I haven't made a project since my college days. Even then I can say this is THE FIRST project I've made fully solo from design, concept, just everything. Obviously google was my help but even then shit was mad hard n tedious n time consuming as it is."
